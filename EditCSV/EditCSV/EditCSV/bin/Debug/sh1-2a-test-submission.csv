Well anyway

wendy, OK one large loan renewed 197 thousand 100
They paid they reduced no problem
In town this line of credit has agreed so its pretty routine
First long request I have is an existing real estate mortgage that will be refinanced into the secondary market of Fannie Mae customers coming in at 6158 East St in IL The requesting $84000 on a 30 year fanny
Loan this would include the cost of doing the refinance appraisal title work and points 8484 Even their monthly payment of principle interest taxes and insurance would be 76189 based at the current 30 year rate
They estimate the value of their home to be $110000
We had an appraisal in 1991 by a certified appraiser that indicates the value The house was 103 thousand dollars 80 of that would make it 8024 So in order to make them along for 84000 it must praise for 105 so that will be will determine whether or not
84 and whether they have to come up with some money out of pocket
Their assets total 1164 17 Their liabilities 83 their net worth 31 So I lose the house They currently have a debt to income of 28 over 27 and aft
They would have a debt to income of 15 over 23
Where they know I missed that there are 15 over there are currently 20
Over 2720 over 27 yeah I couldnt even read My my own writing Its 20 over 27 and after the refi is 15 over 23 What is acceptable pretty much 28 over 36
Search figures and never did know what was high and low dont make any difference Yeah 1515 over 23 So the debt to income isnt a problem The problem is I see it is the value of the house number one and the second matter hand is that in 1980
They had filed a Chapter 11 they had at the time of mortgage with us They reaffirmed on that mortgage They were never laid we after that discharge We even advanced them money to purchase this house on East Street here
Theyve never missed a payment on that loan Ive also made them car loans that theyve never missed a payment on and according to Fannie Mae guidelines with long as they have been discharged at least 2 years and re established and paid as agreed their credit obligation
Qualify for a Fannie Mae Mortgage
With that in mind I am moving that theyre that we approve this loan request subject to a certified appraisal of their home
Do we have the discharge Yes I have a copy of it when Brazil it was discharged on
November a note 22388
Discharge date was 223 of 88  11 87113 months pretty fast It was a business know it was a business bankruptcy and I was pretty cut and dried they just were illuminating the business
And apparently nobody objected to the bankruptcy since they reaffirmed with this secured creditors all the debt That was charged that was filed bankruptcy against was unsecured creditors
And in discharge him before they even performed or anything
Now the 3 minute I guess so on a particular period of time coz Heres the unusual that they dont require that you know usually they put him on a 2 year 3 years playing or something
See that from what I gathered is the unsecured creditors got nothing and the secured creditors just carried on their payment History is agree as originally set forth in their contracts
We can usually the plan or hear protection for those unsecured creditors but weve got the discharge
OK thats hard to believe because it says it notice of joint discharge a joint debtors it It appears the persons named above filed a petition commencing joint case under title 11 on November 23rd 1987 and then in order release has been entered
Objecting to the discharge of the debtors was filed within the time fixed by the court What was at 10 minutes and and and that there we can get the court I know thats ridiculous dated February 23rd 1988
3 months I just yeah thats what I was just I assumed it would have been like 80 or 92 or something What would actually happen to them was She opened a franchise and it was a franchise of doing packaging sending this from all bases
Packaging gift wrapping and shipping well what happened They should have gotten into the business Hindsight is 2020 They should have gotten into the business and lets say August and then they would had a Christmas season There was it got to be real complicated and they didnt get in until February while February they had nothing to do
They hung in there for a year and a half and they just couldnt couldnt see into a very nobody shipping anything
So its moved and seconded to approve that loan subject to the appraisal by certified appraisal in the matches 84
OK all in favor II suppose same time motion carries
Theres only one thats the only loan I have I got one small one dont resent in here is because the bar was already have 303000 tomorrow so it has to be approved by the board But if we if its approved today that be too and Ill have to call 2 more
They want to borrow 4012 he wants to borrow 4500 dollars to finish paying off the renovation and upgrade necessary on the daycare
He had initially thought was he born would do it and then he bought some money from his uncle he wants to repay dont come get that out the way he wants to stay there for a year it would be secured by 3 vehicles
Incomes relatively high but is in terms going up the daycare scheduled open
A week after the fifth so we around the 12th to 15th of January
He thought he was already opened and then they came back in and told him he couldnt open cause Theres articles in the paper and they showed the kids to daycare and he had his ads out and everything But he didnt have all the Is dotted and Ts crossed the state came back and said well now we can
So one group of state people the people that do all do the testing for electrical and safety and stuff have been there Now the state inspectors got a commune I guess They just look at the quality of the facility not necessarily the wiring plumbing and heating but is it clean and is it safe and that sort of thing theyre supposed to be there the fifth
The delay told him that it usually takes
A week for them to send a report in and for their license to come back So he anticipates that theyll be open No later than the 12 the 15th He gave me some numbers I cant remember theyve got like 13 or 14 kids are already taking care of mostly out of their house until I can get him down and 89 more so they feel
To exceed the projection but right now they dont have any income other than from his job so
Thats a fairly large scale that hes going to building 185 people Theres no at least see their children Yeah theyre expecting that many fairly quickly and then he hopes to get up around 50 See theyre looking at 4 people Plus Ive got to the building and it is very very nicely
Nicely done operation I mean theres nothing shall be about the workmanship or the quality of the material or the cleanliness of the of the building is it attached onto his storage facility know its free standing building building buildings Dad had his cabinet shop and was living in it
In quarters and all that into this thing its like anything when youre dealing with regulators in the state They said they got 2 ladies for 9 counties and they theres a lot of this going on and they can only get to so many so I would move since its a cure for 4500 Its on a 12 month repayment which is relatively short
We advance the phones Ill 2nd it is said they all pretty much dont a 303000 and some odd dollars But hes always serviced I mean hes never been laid hes always paid as agreed
And they do have the income It just right now in the income doesnt well I say they have it once the daycare gets up to 20 people theyll have another income to theyll fall back into the 40 but right now Theyre over the 40 because we cant show any income from the daycare but
And I said hes always service that is agreed and his overall debt is working damage is quite a bit of death You just I guess you cant say too much of their ban on time and I think theyre bad long as everything works out good Thank you Hes already talking if this thing goes like they think it is next fall He just wanted to
Expand in that storage facility on those things I think theyre always going to have quite a bit of death loans cash flow keep up with it Could you at least thats kind of their hes looking at his retirement income in an investment is whole bit you like some of the people do here
Well its been moved and seconded to approve but that we cant really disperse on that that due to his size of until we have all they need for Jordy Board member for at least 2 more board members because Im voting voting in favor of paper since your second I assume sorry
I get older 2 more is going to be old but he didnt He didnt get in till after he was gone himself Thats only one I have
Any other loans no other long as we discussed
I gotta couple things here but will the one
Is in regard to
The retail non deposit investment just kind of bring us up to speed
Mark is tentatively accepted our offer for employment
But since hes going to be a dual employee that you really dont need to put this into minutes Ill Ill Ill catch up the board up to speed I just want us to know because it has some long relevance
He was interviewed by LCL very hard interview team over the telephone yesterday and Larry Call me this morning that should called about 730 and said everything went fine
What we have setup is marks going up to Chicago at else else office on
For Monday evening Tuesday and Wednesday training Monday evening and Tuesday training will be very specific for him Their Workflow their forms Hell get to meet these people on Wednesday Then hell be in a little bit of a larger group there maybe 4 or 5 other asset managers with him discussing sales
And sales approaches and strategies
Larry said he doesnt know how much is going to plug into US
Philosophically on how well hes known into the area he said Thats our decision of which Im comfortable with I wanted Larry to tell me how he thinks hes going to do plugging into selling and he said Oh he should be He should do very well so Im that looks good what I did kind of in regard to the
And I dont have this date finalized but Im trying to go Maybe the second week of January to have
A representative a banker systems come here to do some specialized training within the qualified retirement plan area needs needs an understanding of
Not a detailed understanding but how all these qualified plans work so that he
Can have so he understands how his products plug into the the self directed IRAs at CPS in the light We also it would do us good to know what products we can offer under those qualified retirement plans So ragala know I believe is his name is supposed to come down
But
Hell be here on it for a day and I wanted him to talk with more myself and some time During the day to the 2 of you because his loan officers You have a good handle on borrowers and can kind of tell him of these SC peas and some of the other products weve kind of
In offering those well we have not offered the self directed offering the self directed Were getting is simply We need to get a diff 50 different forms set of called an IRA Its got an IRA SD for self directed and then that will allow people to if they dont want all their funds
CDs are custodial I rearrangement see the existing ira says all those phones have to be in First National Bank Mobile The self directed the participants signs a investment direction are where where he directs
The investments they sign the form and then you invest in whatever they want to the how that works like with the SEPs DHCP
Has a vehicle has to be connected to the IRA so we take the SCP off the shelf and then if the person wants that money put into a bank CD then we just use our custodial Ira forms if they want a self directed up SCP you take the same Sep form off
Using a different ira youre not using the custodial I rearrangement in Sep must have an IRA attached to it so that I raise all fit in the same plan Theyre just different
Which box is checked off of this overall plan that the overall plans What youre talking about Whos back thats what the IRS is blessed is the framework and so long as you stay within the framework in some combination Youre OK exactly so I had talked with Rick Brady today and hes going to send me those 4
Take a look at him the other The thing which makes it a little more complicated But its really not a cost Its kind of a flip flop in that he recommended we dont try and do the account maintenance on those self directed IRAs ourselves because of how complicated the lawyers and all this so I mean coincidence
Im still offers a comprehensive account maintenance services that surprised that such a surprise and what we would do is they would take care of the account maintenance in a similar manner if you will as
They take care of the other qualified plan
They we send them the information but they they they crank out the numbers and they file whatever needs to be filed that its really not going to cost us Its going to be pretty much of a slump right now we use their 800 number and their find their newsletter for
We dont have other comprehensive service We have there a service and that runs about $300 a year
If you go to the comprehensive account maintenance
The 800 number is included in the in the newsletters included so we would drop $300 off the account maintenance comprehensive account maintenance maintenance would cost us $500 But what you do is they he estimates it be $500 for a minimal number of counts banker system charges 35
In account and he said under self directed arrangement he seen charges to maintain a self directed IRA anywhere from 4250 dollars and I think $150 is a lot to maintain a self directed ira so I mean we could pass that back to the customer
Which are just 500 + 35 for account Well he thought he was going to send me down the information know how the typical salesman They they talking kind of nebulous terms But he thought they they have a minimum number of accounts is covered if you will by 500 yes and so he said
The way I understood it would lets say 500 would cover the 800 which is very very helpful service and the maintenance for lets say 20 accounts Well if we had 10 accounts We would charge $550 on unaccounted be $500 Its really kind of a switch around but
I think it would be good for the 5 or 6 of us too
To have galleano down here can kind of explain What products we can offer from the bank side but it needs know that and we all need to know that and then we can figure out how marks the products that else all is going to offer will plug into the
And its I was thinking of sending moved up there for a week But hes up there week Hes going to learn a lot of very technical information such as like this Section 415 excess is that I was talking about you really dont need to know that the technical nitty gritty about it because
Systems does they take care of the nitty gritty so its going to be less expensive to have gallon oh come here instead of one person going up to Minnesota for a week and then trying to bring back the information Were going to have galleano come down here for a day and he wont he wont touch any specific
Items such as 415 accesses are ACP testing or that because moon and I kind of know that but if we dont know that like that 415 XSI called the 800 number and they went through the explanation where the IRS changed the deduction
Whos going to hold the account is LCL going to hold the account is the bank gonna hopefully account who asked You talk about bank products and else all products like before the Trust Department If you will held the account that thats physically where it was
Land going to be in the bank or will the plan BLCL or that is the plan
Just kind of nebulous well the SCP in the IRA will be First National Bank of movement But those products If you will we offer those and then LCL will have within that plan Theyll have things you can buy if you want to direct it That way that if they dont want to see
Something else you could direct it that the moneys be used to buy some mutual fund or some bond fund or something and how I envision that then we would get the statement from LCL for the Mutual Fund Holdings Lets say the person also had a CD done matter how excluding
Then what what we would have to do is pull that information together we would get LCL statement As of the end of the year What the income was and what the balance was we would then have to if they had a CD pull that and we would report that up the banker systems and they would then combine that an produce the report it
Normally a cost in the self directed because its not with our CDs Now that information Thats the whole account and whatevers out there on the on the retiring the rap record just passes right up and then the CD in the rap information retirement account processing system
When you get another vendor in here like LCL We physically have to put the papers together but its not that complicated But the name of his office is going to be LCL Its not going to be First National Bank right right I gotta I love expansions of business It took me 45 minutes to get a phone number the phone number by the way is
Is what the phone number will be But this is things that Im anxious for move to get here because Im getting Im getting tuckered out trying to get all these nitty gritty things Its not tough to get the phone number but see they need the phone number in order to order letter head in order to have business cards LCL
To get that process going to actually counts going to be maintained here I mean there is it going to be a separate theyre going to have an account in Chicago for the funds to pass through is there going to be passed through funds here at the bank or is that well what will do is those are probably wire transfer out means or something well through
I think what will happen But we will find this out and I mean will get involved in it and Im Im not whichever way it goes is fine but probably the most sophisticated way will be everyone who makes who buys a fund or whatever that money will go into a clearing account here and then we
Either LCL Willacy agent out of us or will physically wired up there There may be 100 thousand dollars in there which may represent 3 peoples or 4 peoples purchases and then more facts is the paperwork up Dale CL
And they do the suitability testing and then they know what products have been bought and then on the other side We do a wire transfer to physically get the money up there I think thats how its more yes Same same same type of thing that custodial account and then
How much of it is theres
By calling up there and that dial
They zap it the next day yeah I dont know if thats the same way that American Express with the travelers checks were when we sell travelers checks We put that money in a clearing account and then were daughter name or somebody calls whos ever doing that job calls a number and we report how much
Sales we had and they they hit the account the next day and take the money out but thats kind of the mechanics of the flow of funds but to answer your question Bowl is that LCL that office will not save First National Bank of mental or anything of that nature
His card will be else L investments at First National Bank of mobile and the letter head will be else L there needs to be a separate phone line going to that office Now we will be at when we get this reception is set up the reception is will also answer it But when they pick up the phone and we will put it on
Blue line or something like that when they pick up that line like we do with the most number They pick up and theyll say LCL Investments They also these are requirements by LCL and its also requirements by yeah I guess Nasdaq or whomever and the controller that they dont want us when that line rings were
Hello first megabyte then they go Oh Yeah I wanted to talk about a mutual fund Oh Im sorry yeah you do have LCL investments I mean these are some of the nitty gritty things They talk about in the regulation Im pretty confident that they will implement those out but were going to carry on his other livelihood that he had before through that office third
Totally out of the insurance business He was meeting with they had a regional meeting Our meeting with their regional manager today and he was going to tell him that hes plans to take a job here Common courtesy says that he needs to give him 2 weeks notice
But the practice within the industry and Larry Moore said this and also very hard said this so I know its not employer Its just within that industry as soon as a person says Ive decided to move onto another another customer another employer then come
Did you need to talk to movies Ill see if shes going to be at a number where I could talk to her and maybe a half an hour 45 minutes or else Ill give her a call tomorrow as soon as they get notice They typically say will find thanks for the 2 weeks notice but its effective today and then they electronic
Transfer his license is to hit 22 LCL
