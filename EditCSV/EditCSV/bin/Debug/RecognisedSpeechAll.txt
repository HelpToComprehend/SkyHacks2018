502 wipers on the car at the recommended Mcmahan tire downtown and so I didn't have to haggle about what kind of tires or where to put in front or back. Allen County Motors already told me you know all that stuff.
I made them get me my Tire 'cause I couldn't drive anywhere.
You can afford to mess around with our car. You just can't were like, Yeah, but I put great wipers on for 5 bucks. Now, if yours cost 15. That's ridiculous much they cost 15 + 3 hours.
The best wipers money can buy you see mine, but they did double way. I'll tell you what, though for the effort. That sounds really bad for the effort. The time that it takes to go out and get him and install am I'd rather pay the money. 'cause of our time is we just do not have time to f*** around some more money on clothes.

My mama loves that's why I take all my love all of our alterations. Go to Edna. I gotta read it? Did you know that? Did she tell you they've gone to South church down South the little tiny one and one edit told me about?
Because they sort of wanted to go to a smaller congregation. But when they announced in church and we prayed for them. It was because they?
But they were gonna go out because they felt called so I don't know what the real story is.
Almost there. I think their motives must be pretty solid. They want to talk to Ron about it and make it a public thing. Yeah, yeah, they really need in fact, oh. I love him when he had his they had to cut his sweats.
When yesterday, he was so upset about that. You took him into Edna. She picks up for free when you can't even tell that they want and I don't even think they cut him on on the scene. Yeah, they tried to really try to ride to. She did a great job with it. That's been taking a lot of she she.
I can't get over Gramma makes us a quilt and she makes a double bed. Quilt for King size bed, so of course, it doesn't fit so, so you're giving it to me, I bought some extra.

You should wear them over here party. I got it. Missy oh now. You put it back up. Homie device homing device lock up when you think I'd be gross gross gross.
Well anyway.
OK, one large loan renewed 197 thousand 100.
They paid they reduced no problem.
In town this line of credit has agreed so it's pretty routine.
First long request, I have is an existing real estate mortgage that will be refinanced into the secondary market of Fannie Mae customers coming in at 6158 East St in IL. The requesting $84,000 on a 30 year fanny.
Loan this would include the cost of doing the refinance appraisal title work and points, 8484. Even their monthly payment of principle interest taxes and insurance would be 76189 based at the current 30 year rate.
They estimate the value of their home to be $110,000.
We had an appraisal in 1991 by a certified appraiser that indicates the value. The house was 103 thousand dollars. 80% of that would make it 8024. So, in order to make them along for 84,000 it must praise for 105, so that will be will determine whether or not.
84 and whether they have to come up with some money out of pocket.
Their assets total 1164 17. Their liabilities 83, their net worth 31. So I lose the house. They currently have a debt to income of 28 over 27 and aft.
They would have a debt to income of 15 over 23.
Where they know I missed that there are 15 over there are currently 20?
Over 2720 over 27, yeah, I couldn't even read. My my own writing. It's 20 over 27 and after the refi is 15 over 23? What is acceptable pretty much 28 over 36?
Search figures and never did know what was high and low don't make any difference. Yeah, 1515 over 23. So the debt to income isn't a problem. The problem is, I see it is the value of the house number one and the second matter hand is that in 1980.
They had filed a Chapter 11, they had at the time of mortgage with us. They reaffirmed on that mortgage. They were never laid we after that discharge. We even advanced them money to purchase this house on East Street here.
They've never missed a payment on that loan. I've also made them car loans that they've never missed a payment on and according to Fannie Mae guidelines with long as they have been discharged at least 2 years and re established and paid as agreed their credit obligation.
Qualify for a Fannie Mae Mortgage.
With that in mind, I am moving that they're that we approve this loan request subject to a certified appraisal of their home.
Do we have the discharge? Yes, I have a copy of it when Brazil it was discharged on?
November a note 22388.
Discharge date was 223 of 88 / 11, 87113 months pretty fast. It was a business know it was a business bankruptcy and I was pretty cut and dried they just were illuminating the business.
And apparently nobody objected to the bankruptcy since they reaffirmed with this secured creditors all the debt. That was charged that was filed bankruptcy against was unsecured creditors.
And in discharge him before they even performed or anything.
Now the 3 minute I guess so on a particular period of time coz. Here's the unusual that they don't require that you know, usually they put him on a 2 year 3 years playing or something.
See that from what I gathered is the unsecured creditors got nothing and the secured creditors just carried on their payment. History is agree as originally set forth in their contracts.
We can usually the plan or hear protection for those unsecured creditors, but we've got the discharge.
OK, that's hard to believe, because it says it notice of joint discharge a joint debtors it. It appears the persons named above filed a petition commencing joint case under title 11 on November 23rd 1987 and then in order release has been entered.
Objecting to the discharge of the debtors was filed within the time fixed by the court. What was at 10 minutes and and and that there we can get the court. I know that's ridiculous dated February 23rd 1988.
3 months I just yeah that's what I was just I assumed it would have been like 80 or 92 or something? What would actually happen to them was. She opened a franchise and it was a franchise of doing packaging, sending this from all bases.
Packaging gift, wrapping and shipping well, what happened. They should have gotten into the business. Hindsight is 2020. They should have gotten into the business and let's say August and then they would had a Christmas season. There was, it got to be real complicated and they didn't get in until February while February they had nothing to do.
They hung in there for a year and a half and they just couldn't couldn't see into a very nobody shipping anything.
So it's moved and seconded to approve that loan subject to the appraisal by certified appraisal in the matches 84.
OK, all in favor II suppose same time motion carries.
There's only one that's the only loan I have. I got one small one don't resent in here is because the bar was already have 303,000 tomorrow, so it has to be approved by the board. But if we if it's approved today that be too and I'll have to call 2 more.
They want to borrow 4012 he wants to borrow 4500 dollars to finish paying off the renovation and upgrade necessary on the daycare.
He had initially thought was he born would do it and then he bought some money from his uncle, he wants to repay don't come get that out, the way he wants to stay there for a year it would be secured by 3 vehicles.
Incomes relatively high, but is in terms going up the daycare scheduled open.
A week after the fifth so we around the 12th to 15th of January.
He thought he was already opened and then they came back in and told him he couldn't open 'cause. There's articles in the paper and they showed the kids to daycare and he had his ads out and everything. But he didn't have all the I's dotted and T's crossed the state came back and said well now we can.
So one group of state people, the people that do all do the testing for electrical and safety and stuff have been there. Now the state inspectors got a commune I guess. They just look at the quality of the facility, not necessarily the wiring plumbing and heating, but is it clean and is it safe and that sort of thing they're supposed to be there, the fifth.
The delay told him that it usually takes.
A week for them to send a report in and for their license to come back. So he anticipates that they'll be open. No later than the 12 the 15th. He gave me some numbers. I can't remember they've got like 13 or 14 kids are already taking care of mostly out of their house until I can get him down and 89 more so they feel.
To exceed the projection, but right now, they don't have any income other than from his job so.
That's a fairly large scale that he's going to building 185 people. There's no at least see their children. Yeah, they're expecting that many fairly quickly and then he hopes to get up around 50. See they're looking at 4 people. Plus, I've got to the building and it is very, very nicely.
Nicely done operation, I mean, there's nothing shall be about the workmanship or the quality of the material or the cleanliness of the of the building is it attached onto his storage facility know it's free standing building building buildings. Dad had his cabinet shop and was living in it.
In quarters and all that into this thing it's like anything when you're dealing with regulators in the state. They said they got 2 ladies for 9 counties and they there's a lot of this going on and they can only get to so many so I would move since it's a cure for 4500. It's on a 12 month repayment, which is relatively short.
We advance the phones. I'll 2nd it is said they all pretty much don't a 303,000 and some odd dollars. But he's always serviced. I mean he's never been laid he's always paid as agreed.
And they do have the income. It just right now in the income doesn't well. I say they have it once the daycare gets up to 20 people they'll have another income to they'll fall back into the 40% but right now. They're over the 40 because we can't show any income from the daycare, but.
And I said he's always service that is agreed and his overall debt is working damage is quite a bit of death. You just I guess you can't say too much of their ban on time and I think they're bad long as everything works out good. Thank you. He's already talking if this thing goes like they think it is next fall. He just wanted to.
Expand in that storage facility on those things I think they're always going to have quite a bit of death loans cash flow keep up with it. Could you at least that's kind of their he's looking at his retirement income in an investment is whole bit you like some of the people do here.
Well, it's been moved and seconded to approve but that we can't really disperse on that that due to his size of until we have all they need for Jordy Board member for at least 2 more board members because I'm voting voting in favor of paper since your second. I assume sorry.
I get older 2 more is going to be old, but he didn't. He didn't get in till after he was gone himself. That's only one, I have.
Any other loans no other long as we discussed.
I gotta couple things here, but will the one.
Is in regard to?
The retail non deposit investment just kind of bring us up to speed.
Mark is tentatively accepted our offer for employment.
But since he's going to be a dual employee that you really don't need to put this into minutes. I'll I'll I'll catch up the board up to speed. I just want us to know because it has some long relevance.
He was interviewed by LCL very hard interview team over the telephone yesterday and Larry. Call me this morning that should called about 7:30 and said everything went fine.
What we have setup is marks going up to Chicago at else else office on?
For Monday evening Tuesday and Wednesday training Monday evening and Tuesday training will be very specific for him. Their Workflow, their forms. He'll get to meet these people on Wednesday. Then he'll be in a little bit of a larger group, there, maybe 4 or 5 other asset managers with him discussing sales.
And sales approaches and strategies.
Larry said he doesn't know how much is going to plug into US.
Philosophically on how well he's known into the area, he said. That's our decision of which I'm comfortable with. I wanted Larry to tell me how he thinks he's going to do plugging into selling and he said. Oh, he should be. He should do very well so I'm that looks good what I did kind of in regard to the.
And I don't have this date finalized but I'm trying to go. Maybe the second week of January to have.
A representative a banker systems come here to do some specialized training within the qualified retirement plan area needs needs an understanding of.
Not a detailed understanding, but how all these qualified plans work so that he.
Can have so he understands how his products plug into the the self directed IRA's at CPS in the light? We also it would do us good to know what products we can offer under those qualified retirement plans. So ragala know I believe is his name is supposed to come down.
But.
He'll be here on, it for a day and I wanted him to talk with more myself and some time. During the day to the 2 of you because his loan officers. You have a good handle on borrowers and can kind of tell him of these SC peas and some of the other products we've kind of.
In offering those well, we have not offered the self directed offering the self directed. We're getting is simply. We need to get a diff 50 different forms set of called an IRA. It's got an IRA SD for self directed and then that will allow people to if they don't want all their funds.
CD's are custodial I rearrangement see the existing ira says all those phones have to be in First National Bank Mobile. The self directed the participants signs a investment direction are where where he directs.
The investments they sign the form and then you invest in whatever they want to the how that works like with the SEP's DHCP.
Has a vehicle has to be connected to the IRA so we take the SCP off the shelf and then if the person wants that money put into a bank CD, then we just use our custodial. Ira forms if they want a self directed up SCP you take the same Sep form off.
Using a different ira you're not using the custodial. I rearrangement in Sep must have an IRA attached to it, so that I raise all fit in the same plan. They're just different.
Which box is checked off of this overall plan that the overall plans? What you're talking about? Who's back that's what the IRS is blessed is the framework and so long as you stay within the framework in some combination. You're OK exactly so I had talked with Rick Brady today and he's going to send me those 4.
Take a look at him the other. The thing which makes it a little more complicated. But it's really not a cost. It's kind of a flip flop in that he recommended we don't try and do the account maintenance on those self directed. IRA's ourselves because of how complicated the lawyers and all this so I mean coincidence.
I'm still offers a comprehensive account maintenance services that surprised that such a surprise and what we would do is they would take care of the account maintenance in a similar manner if you will as.
They take care of the other qualified plan.
They we send them the information, but they they they crank out the numbers and they file whatever needs to be filed that it's really not going to cost us. It's going to be pretty much of a slump right now, we use their 800 number and their find their newsletter for.
We don't have other comprehensive service. We have there a service and that runs about $300 a year.
If you go to the comprehensive account maintenance.
The 800 number is included in the in the newsletters included so we would drop, $300 off the account maintenance comprehensive account maintenance maintenance would cost us $500. But what you do is they he estimates it be $500 for a minimal number of counts banker system charges 35.
In account and he said under self directed arrangement, he seen charges to maintain a self directed IRA anywhere from 4250 dollars and I think $150 is a lot to maintain a self directed ira, so I mean, we could pass that back to the customer.
Which are just 500 + 35 for account? Well, he thought he was going to send me down the information know how the typical salesman. They they talking kind of nebulous terms. But he thought they they have a minimum number of accounts is covered if you will by 500, yes and so he said.
The way I understood it would let's say 500 would cover the 800 which is very, very helpful service and the maintenance for let's say 20 accounts. Well, if we had 10 accounts. We would charge $550 on unaccounted be $500. It's really kind of a switch around but.
I think it would be good for the 5 or 6 of us too.
To have galleano down here can kind of explain? What products we can offer from the bank side, but it needs know that and we all need to know that and then we can figure out how marks the products that else all is going to offer will plug into the.
And it's I was thinking of sending moved up there for a week. But he's up there week. He's going to learn a lot of very technical information such as like this. Section 4:15 excess is that I was talking about you really don't need to know that the technical nitty, gritty about it because.
Systems does they take care of the nitty gritty so it's going to be less expensive to have gallon oh come here instead of one person going up to Minnesota for a week and then trying to bring back the information. We're going to have galleano come down here for a day and he won't, he won't touch any specific.
Items such as 4:15 accesses are ACP testing or that because moon and I kind of know that, but if we don't know that, like that 4:15 XSI called the 800 number and they went through the explanation where the IRS changed the deduction.
Who's going to hold the account is LCL going to hold the account is the bank gonna hopefully account who asked. You talk about bank products and else all products like before the Trust Department. If you will held the account that that's physically where it was.
Land going to be in the bank or will the plan B&LCL or that is the plan.
Just kind of nebulous well the SCP in the IRA will be First National Bank of movement. But those products. If you will we offer those and then LCL will have within that plan. They'll have things you can buy if you want to direct it. That way that if they don't want to see.
Something else you could direct it that the moneys be used to buy some mutual fund or some bond fund or something and how I envision that then we would get the statement from LCL for the Mutual Fund Holdings. Let's say the person also had a CD done matter how excluding?
Then what what we would have to do is pull that information together, we would get LCL statement. As of the end of the year. What the income was and what the balance was we would then have to, if they had a CD pull that and we would report that up the banker systems and they would then combine that an produce the report it.
Normally a cost in the self directed because it's not with our CDs. Now that information. That's the whole account and whatever's out there on the on the retiring the rap record just passes right up and then the CD in the rap information retirement account processing system.
When you get another vendor in here like LCL. We physically have to put the papers together but it's not that complicated. But the name of his office is going to be LCL. It's not going to be First National Bank right right. I gotta I love expansions of business. It took me 45 minutes to get a phone number, the phone number by the way is.
Is what the phone number will be? But this is things that I'm anxious for move to get here because I'm getting I'm getting tuckered out trying to get all these nitty gritty things. It's not tough to get the phone number, but see they need the phone number in order to order letter head in order to have business cards LCL.
To get that process going to actually counts going to be maintained here. I mean, there is it going to be a separate they're going to have an account in Chicago for the funds to pass through is there going to be passed through funds here at the bank or is that well what will do is those are probably wire transfer out means or something well through.
I think what will happen. But we will find this out and I mean will get involved in it, and I'm I'm not whichever way it goes is fine, but probably the most sophisticated way will be everyone who makes who buys a fund or whatever that money will go into a clearing account here and then we
Either LCL Willacy agent out of us or will physically wired up there. There may be 100 thousand dollars in there, which may represent 3 peoples or 4 people's purchases and then more facts is the paperwork up Dale CL.
And they do the suitability testing and then they know what products have been bought and then on the other side. We do a wire transfer to physically get the money up there. I think that's how it's more yes. Same same same type of thing that custodial account and then.
How much of it is there's
By calling up there and that dial.
They zap it the next day, yeah, I don't know if that's the same way that American Express with the travelers checks were when we sell travelers checks. We put that money in a clearing account and then we're daughter name or somebody calls who's ever doing that job calls a number and we report how much.
Sales we had, and they they hit the account the next day and take the money out, but that's kind of the mechanics of the flow of funds, but to answer your question Bowl is that LCL that office will not save. First National Bank of mental or anything of that nature.
His card will be else L investments at First National Bank of mobile and the letter head will be else. L there needs to be a separate phone line going to that office. Now we will be at when we get this reception is set up the reception is will also answer it. But when they pick up the phone and we will put it on.
Blue line or something like that when they pick up that line like we do with the most number. They pick up and they'll say LCL Investments. They also these are requirements by LCL and it's also requirements by yeah. I guess Nasdaq or whomever and the controller that they don't want us when that line rings were.
Hello first megabyte, then they go Oh Yeah, I wanted to talk about a mutual fund. Oh, I'm sorry, yeah, you do have LCL investments. I mean, these are some of the nitty gritty things. They talk about in the regulation. I'm pretty confident that they will implement those out, but we're going to carry on his other livelihood that he had before through that office third.
Totally out of the insurance business. He was meeting with they had a regional meeting. Our meeting with their regional manager today and he was going to tell him that he's plans to take a job here. Common courtesy says that he needs to give him 2 weeks notice.
But the practice within the industry and Larry Moore said this and also very hard, said this so I know it's not employer. It's just within that industry as soon as a person says. I've decided to move onto another another customer another employer, then come.
Did you need to talk to movies? I'll see if she's going to be at a number where I could talk to her and maybe a half an hour, 45 minutes or else I'll give her a call tomorrow as soon as they get notice. They typically say will find thanks for the 2 weeks notice, but it's effective today and then they electronic.
Transfer his license is to hit 22 LCL.
